  Stores a mapping of strings to other objects. See [dictionaries](Syntax.md#dictionaries).

  You can also iterate over dictionaries with the [`foreach`
  statement](Syntax.md#foreach-statements).

  *(since 0.48.0)*: Dictionaries can be added (e.g. `d1 = d2 + d3` and `d1 += d2`).
  Values from the second dictionary overrides values from the first.
  *(since 0.62.0)*: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.
